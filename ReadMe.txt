Requirements (these are the versions I use, if the versions aren't exact don't worry it will probably work)
===============================
Python 3.11.9    - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/
Ursina 7.0.0     - In command line (press windows key and type "cmd"), write "python -m pip install Ursina"
imageio 2.37.0   - In command line (press windows key and type "cmd"), write "python -m pip install imageio"


Instructions for installing the game
===============================
1. Download latest release "source code.zip", do not fork this repository and run a codespace, it will not work
- Any other way of downloading from github like pulling the repo is fine too
2. Extract the zip and make sure the main folder that everything is in (so the folder with main.py etc.) has no spaces in it


Instructions for running the game
===============================
Open RunGame.bat
Otherwise if that doesn't work:
1. Download the requirements above
2. If you already have a way to open python files use that, otherwise open the folder the main.py file is located in, right click anywhere in the file (not on any of the files) and click "Open in Terminal"
3. In the command line that it opens, write "python main.py"

- If you don't use windows you'll probably have to look up how to open it if none of that works
- Anywhere I say to write "python _____" in command line, you can try replacing it with "python3 ____" or "py ____" if it doesn't work


Note
================================
Note that this game is not finished so if it looks bad that's why. It should be mostly functional and bug free I hope
Take screenshots of any bugs, cool snippets, etc. while playing the game for the form please

Also having the game console (so if you ran it from command line it would be the command line) open might help you, and if it screams at you that there is a debug statement please take a screenshot if you can
I did not make any of the audio, credits below
When you go into a portal, wait a bit before loading rooms or they might not load at all, I'm just going to say this is on purpose and it's portal sickness
If there is a boss spawner on top of a portal, the boss will just camp the portal until you come back (this definately did NOT happen to me)
If there are 2 portals in the same room, I can't guarentee going through them is a good idea (I actually haven't tried this)
If your monitor aspect ratio isn't 16:9 it will break things, you can change your display resolution to a 16:9 aspect ratio and that will probably fix it
Dev highscore is 100 damage, 53 rooms :)
