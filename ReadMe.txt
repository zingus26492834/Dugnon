Requirements (these are the versions I use, if the versions aren't exact don't worry it will probably work)
===============================
Python 3.11.9    - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/
Ursina 7.0.0     - In command line (press windows key and type "cmd"), write "python -m pip install Ursina"
imageio 2.37.0   - In command line (press windows key and type "cmd"), write "python -m pip install imageio"


Instructions for installing the game
===============================
1. Download latest release "source code.zip", do not fork this repository and run a codespace, it will not work
- Any other way of downloading from github like pulling the repo is fine too
2. Extract the zip and make sure the main folder that everything is in (so the folder with main.py etc.) has no spaces in it


Instructions for running the game on windows
===============================
Open RunGame.bat
Otherwise if that doesn't work:
1. Download the requirements above
2. If you already have a way to open python files use that, otherwise open the folder the main.py file is located in, right click anywhere in the file (not on any of the files) and click "Open in Terminal"
3. In the command line that it opens, write "python main.py"


Instructions for running the game on Mac (may not work)
===============================
Open RunGame.command (it may be flagged by antivirus because I'm not a "verified developer")
It also may not work because I haven't tested it.
If that doesn't work or you don't trust me:
1. Download python using the mac installer on the link above
2. press command + space, write "terminal" and press enter
3. navigate to where you put the file using "cd ./"
    - e.g. if it's located in your downloads file "cd ./Users/(your pc username)/Downloads/Dugnon"
    - e.g. if it's located on your desktop "cd ./Users/(your pc username)/Desktop/Dugnon"
    - Replace Dugnon with whatever you named the file, it likely won't be named Dugnon
4. write "python3 main.py"

- I don't have a mac so I just have to trust this will work


Note
================================
- Note that this game is not finished so if it looks bad that's why. It should be mostly functional and bug free I hope
- Take screenshots of any bugs, cool snippets, etc. while playing the game for the form please
- Feedback form - https://forms.gle/dZyNVbkYS5LxEysq5
- Also having the game console (so if you ran it from command line it would be the command line) open might help you, and if it screams at you that there is a debug statement please take a screenshot if you can
- Anywhere I say to write "python _____" in command line, you can try replacing it with "python3 ____" or "py ____" if it doesn't work, mac will need "python3"

- Thanks to Lulu and Liam's laptops for the RunGame.command file (it can only be made on a mac and I use windows)
